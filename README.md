# CplusplusProgram


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This was project 3 from the CS210 class with Dr Kyger. We were able to create a database for a client that analysed their stock and provided visual representation via a histogram as well as numerical dsiplay of the amount of fruits and vegetables that were used in order to know what stock is most popular. 
What did you do particularly well?
  I feel that, the part that I excelled in, was to make sure that the code was well documented and readable for third parties to know exactly how the code executed.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
      I think that thinking of other ways that the data could be displayed where an error might be caused is a place that would probably be an area of improvement. Likewise, how this can be scaled to handle larger sets of data is another area that could potentially be improved. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The hardest part , for me, was to get the name of the input file just right so that the code was able to read it. I think I struggled in this particular problem for a day and a half. For some reason I kept renaming and deleting and downloading the document name and nothing worked until I finally realized that I was using .txt.txt and it finally worked. It took some stepping away and looking at what was right in front on me rather than going to dig and dig looking for bugs. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think that the syntax of C++ is something I quite enjoy. before this particular project, I didn't understand the importance of namespace pollution. So this is something that I will definitely be more careful with. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Lots of commenting, making everything as simple and readable as possible, as well as lots of iterations of the same code but working on adding edge cases as I found errors along the way.
